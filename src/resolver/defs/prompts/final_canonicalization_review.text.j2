You are reviewing the final canonicalization step in an entity resolution pipeline.

Each entity_id represents a cluster of company records that were determined to be the same real-world organization.

Statistics:
- Total records linked: {{ total_records | comma }}
- Total entities (clusters): {{ total_entities | comma }}
- Singleton entities (only one record): {{ singletons | comma }} ({{ pct_singletons }}%)
- Multi-member entities: {{ multi_member_entities | comma }}
- Average cluster size: {{ avg_cluster_size }}
- Largest cluster: {{ max_cluster_size }}
{% if resolved_rows %}
- Canonical company rows in final view: {{ resolved_rows | comma }}
{% endif %}

Provide a short assessment (3â€“5 bulletpoints):
- Does the ratio of singletons to multi-member clusters seem reasonable?
- Are there signs of over-merging (very large clusters) or under-merging (too many singletons)?
- Does the overall entity-to-record ratio suggest good precision/recall balance?
Be concise, factual, and data-driven.
