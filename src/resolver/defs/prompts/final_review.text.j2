You are reviewing the final results of an entity resolution pipeline.

Each record pair was scored and labeled as a match or non-match, then clustered into entities.
Use the statistics below to assess quality, identify potential issues, and summarize how well the
pipeline is performing overall.

### Pair & Model Summary
- Total pairs evaluated: {{ total_pairs | comma }}
- Labeled matches: {{ labeled_positive | comma }}
- Labeled non-matches: {{ labeled_negative | comma }}


### Entity & Cluster Summary
- Total entities: {{ total_entities | comma }}
- Unique entity IDs: {{ unique_entity_ids | comma }}
- Average cluster size: {{ avg_cluster_size }}
- Largest cluster size: {{ largest_cluster }}
- Singleton entities: {{ singleton_entities | comma }}

### Observations requested:
Please provide a short, data-driven summary (3â€“5 bullet points):
- Does the model seem conservative (favoring precision) or liberal (favoring recall)?
- Does the number of singletons or large clusters suggest under- or over-matching?
- Are there any indicators of imbalance or systemic bias?
- Suggest one or two next steps for improving balance between precision and recall.
