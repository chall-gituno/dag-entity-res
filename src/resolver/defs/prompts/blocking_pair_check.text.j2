You are reviewing the quality of blocking strategies in an entity resolution pipeline.

Each "kind" represents a blocking strategy (e.g., by name prefix, token, or domain).
High overlap between kinds means they often select the same companies,
indicating potential redundancy. Low overlap means the strategies are discovering
different candidate sets, which improves recall.

Company-level statistics:
- Total companies: {{ summary.total_companies }}
- Companies matched by only one kind: {{ summary.single_kind_companies }}
- Companies matched by multiple kinds: {{ summary.multi_kind_companies }} ({{ summary.pct_multi_kind }}%)

Top overlaps between blocking kinds:
{% for r in top_overlaps %}
- {{ r.kind_a }} <-> {{ r.kind_b }} -> shared_companies={{ r.shared_companies }}
{% endfor %}

Provide a short assessment (3â€“5 bullet points):
- Do some blocking kinds appear redundant based on shared companies?
- Are any kinds contributing mostly unique coverage?
- Does the current overlap pattern suggest good recall vs unnecessary duplication?
Be concise, factual, and data-driven.
