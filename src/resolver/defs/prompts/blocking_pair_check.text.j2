You are an expert data engineer reviewing the output of an entity-resolution
blocking pipeline. Each blocking "kind" represents a strategy for generating
candidate record pairs. High overlap between kinds means wasted computation and
redundant comparisons. Low overlap means a kind is contributing more unique
candidate pairs.

Here are the overlap statistics:

{% for row in overlap_stats %}
- {{ "%-15s"|format(row.kind) }} â†’ total_pairs={{ row.total_pairs|int }}, distinct_ratio={{ "%.2f"|format(row.distinct_ratio) }}%
{% endfor %}

Based on these results, please provide a concise technical assessment that covers:
1. Which blocking kinds appear to be highly redundant and could be merged, removed, or refined.
2. Which kinds seem to provide valuable, unique coverage of the data space.
3. Whether overall blocking diversity seems healthy or overly overlapping.
4. Any specific recommendations for how to tune thresholds (e.g., prefix length, token rarity) or sequencing of blocking stages.
